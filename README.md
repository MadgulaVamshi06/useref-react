Ref Usage: It uses useRef hook to create references to DOM elements, enabling direct interaction with them.

Debugging with Console Logs: Console logging is employed to understand component behavior and hook execution during different stages, aiding in debugging.

Event Handling: The code handles user input changes and button clicks within the component.

Dynamic Styling: It dynamically changes the background color of an element based on user interaction.

Component Composition: Demonstrates how to compose smaller, reusable components to build complex UIs, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
